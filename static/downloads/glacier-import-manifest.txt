# Glacier Import Manifest Template
#
# Update the manifest key values that contain brackets [] with valid values 
# and save the manifest file.  Make sure to remove the brackets [], e.g.  
# bucket:mybucket is valid, while bucket:[mybucket] is invalid. Save the file
# as MyGlacierImportManifest.txt in the same folder as your AWSCredentials.properties
# file.
# 
# For additional details and more manifest options please see: 
# http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSImportExport/latest/API/index.html
# 
# Fields to Update:
# 1. deviceId - This ID is your storage device's serial number or other unique
# identifier. If your device does not have a unique number, please place a
# sticker with a unique identifier onto the device and then enter that
# identifier as the deviceId, e.g. deviceId:S/N 123XXXY1934883
#
# 2. logPrefix - A prefix for any logs or artifacts placed in the logBucket.
#
# 3. logBucket - Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where AWS Import/Export saves
# logs or artifacts. You must create a bucket before we can save log data to it;
# we do not create the bucket for you. The account (accessKeyId) doing the
# export must have write permissions on this bucket, e.g.
# logBucket:mylogbucket.
#
# 4. eraseDevice - Specify yes to acknowledge that AWS will erase your 
# device following the import operation before shipping it. If the eraseDevice field
# is missing or if the value is not yes, the job request will fail.
# 
# 5. notificationEmail - Enter one or more email addresses, separated
# by semicolons, so we can contact you if there are any problems. If the 
# notificationEmail field is missing or empty, the job request will fail.
# 
# 6. name, street1, city, stateOrProvice, postalCode, country - All of these
# parameters are subparameters of returnAddress. Use these parameters to
# specify where we should return your storage device. Your return address must
# be a physical street address. UPS does not deliver to postal boxes.
#
# 7. phoneNumber - Make sure to include the country code 
#
# 8. company, street2, street3 - A subparameter of returnAddress, which you
# use to specify where we should return your storage device. These fields are
# optional and can be deleted.
