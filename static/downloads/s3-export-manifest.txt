# S3 Export Manifest Template
#
# Update the manifest key values that contain brackets [] with valid values
# and save the manifest file.  Make sure to remove the brackets [], e.g.
# bucket:mybucket is valid, while bucket:[mybucket] is invalid. Save the file
# as MyS3ExportManifest.txt in the same folder as your AWSCredentials.properties
# file.
#
# For additional details and more manifest options please see:
# http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSImportExport/latest/API/index.html
#
# Fields to Update:
# 1. deviceId - This ID is your storage device's serial number or other unique
# identifier. If your device does not have a unique number, please place a
# sticker with a unique identifier onto the device and then enter that
# identifier as the deviceId, e.g. deviceId:S/N 123XXXY1934883
#
# 2. fileSystem - Specifies the file system that you installed on your storage
# device.
# 
# 3. trueCryptPassword - Provide an encryption pass word. AWS will encrypt your
# data with TrueCrypt using the password you provide. You will need the same pass
# word to decrypt your data after you receive it back from AWS. If you do not
# provide a password, the CreateJob request will fail.
#
# 4. logBucket - Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where AWS Import/Export saves
# the export log. You must create a bucket before we can save log data to it;
# we do not create the bucket for you. The account (accessKeyId) doing the
# export must have write permissions on this bucket, e.g.
# logBucket:mylogbucket.
# 
# 5. exportBucket - A subfield of operations that specifies the Amazon S3
# bucket where AWS Import/Export retrieves your data. Each listing under
# operations  must have an exportBucket  parameter. The account specified in
# accessKeyId  must have read permissions on the bucket and objects. If no
# other parameters are specified with the listing, AWS Import/Export exports
# all files in the bucket to your storage device.
#
# 6. name, street1, city, stateOrProvice, postalCode, country - All of these
# parameters are subparameters of returnAddress. Use these parameters to
# specify where we should return your storage device. Your return address must
# be a physical street address. UPS does not deliver to postal boxes.
#
# 7. phoneNumber - Make sure to include the country code 
#
# 8. company, street2, street3 - A subparameter of returnAddress, which you
# use to specify where we should return your storage device. These fields are
# optional and can be deleted.
